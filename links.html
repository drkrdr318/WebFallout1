				You want to know about making games? Here is a site that has your answers. Thor is an awsome guy! He previously worked for Blizzard entertainment
				He also worked for the DOE, Amazon, and has an awsome background in game development. He is doing his own thing as an indie developer, creator of Heartbound, breakfast of champions,
