				<p> Still banging along on here and theres. With the advent of summer and the family time on the computer is slimming for now. Haven't really been working on B.i.T. Just spreading out some time with the summertime as is goes. Still moving forward. </p>


				<br><br>
				06/04/24
				<p> Been working off and on, here and there. Family stuff, some new items on the radar. All-in-all busy work. The house needed some work done. The yard work is of course picking up. Kids beginning the 				summer transistion. Will still be involved programming when its available, or days that its just too hot to be out. Cutting back on alot of doings for the year. Hopefully, we are on track to another 					period of subtle works to make a phenomenal period of progress. Hope all is well. Short this week, also a wednesday post instead of monday. Lots of running going on. Cheers, have fun, have a great 					summer!</p>
				
				<br><br>
				05/28/24
				<p> So dilemma, dilemma, dilemma, dilemma. As seen fit more weird computer stuff happened. Albeit a fresh workup needed. But I am back with little to no issues. Started a different project to test my 				    abilities on a short basis. Have to restart the process, but it is fresh knowledge so off I go again. B.i.T. workup is going well. A little sidetracked, but felt I needed to get some creativity a go 				    since the project scope is rather large and I needed a pick me up. So, moving forward. Enjoying life right now.</p>

				<br><br>
				05/20/24
				<p> OK, the cityscape worked out this time. Nice to feel accomplished about the work. Started textboxes and moving towards interactions with npc types. Will start working the dialog box and trim the
				   array steps here soon. Alot of dialog in the process. Once I get the second room done for 20,000 bc then I can do the transition effects, movement, and the scope in present day. This will lay the 
				   groundwork for the rest of the game. Once I get the intervals down, warping in place for the character, I will start building out from there. Super excited. Better than building scenes and rooms
				   to start with. Although I liked the workup to building the game, it seemed nothing worked cohesively in the process, not to mention the kick back with save files. Crossing fingers for no future
				   mess ups. Backups continue. Once the demo game is up and running for a short dialog and some puzzling, I will branch out from there. Still have to work on the time intervals when interacting with
				   the npc's. Thinking the demo will have a bit of the interactions right off the bat. Not sure it will progress in story venue as the player will have to start from scratch in the full version. 					   Figured this was the best way to keep players in a wanting behavior when the release happens. Hope everyone is doing well.</p>

				<p>Hello everyone! Started the rebound this week with a working game version of B.i.T. Had some ins and outs while programming and art work. An entire sidewalk out of scope with the player. Starting
				   over with the cityscape (sidewalk). Not a big deal per say, but I did have to baseline the style and the POV. A major piece of work right now. As it may be, the time in doing art at this level just
				   takes time and, as you can see, art panels just makes up the mojority of work. Programming is always fun bringing the game to life. Although, doing animations now is quicker in my mind. Which had been 				   a monumental task at one point, getting better though.  Hope everyone is doing well. Lots of work and keeping up. Health wise I am cruising along. Major fixes done. Diet, exercise, all the micro 					   concepts evened out. Downsizing my weight, thankfully. Caffeine out the door. Blood pressure nominal. All good aspects. Happy in a nut shell, the brain just doesn't co-op sometimes. Happens but coping.				   Take care of yourself, see the doc when needed. Cheers. <p>

				<p> You know when it seems all is right, the least of things let you down. As it may be, again, Gamemaker had an update. Nothing unusal, updated as normal. Went and loaded B.i.T, same as always, ran the				    game as always and had an error. Strange not unusual though. I reviewed the error and supposedly gms could not find the assets I just created last week. Ran it again and more errors. Okay update to			 	    to gms was a flop, reinstall. Ran again, same error except now the files are loading as iOS. Anyone knows me and the bane of Apple in this world. Tried again. New error, same reference. Checked the 				    folder. No assets. Same files, and same bat file. Can't figure out the issue. File reverences are logged in as iOS. Removed the file lines, no file load. okay delete folder, get backup copy, reload 			 	    file, same problem. Files associated with iOS. I DIDN"T EVEN LOAD THE VERSION OF iOS TO GMS TO BEGIN WITH! No idea what the heck gms did. Reloaded gms, runtime files, same problem. Okay reverted back				    to previous stable version. Won't read the backup files or even load the assets. So all in all, all copies of B.i.T are useless. Spent most of the weekend finding a workaround to no avail. Seems as it
				    will be a total restart. Well, push back again. Will see how it moves forward in the months ahead. Although going to build a differnt route with programming first and then a change up to the assets as
				   I go. Bad taste about the whole ordeal. But its life I guess. Pressing forward. Oh and never knew that saving to the cloud was a big issue for gms. Had to fix save file location.  <p>

			
				<br><br>
				04/25/24
				<p> Been slow moving this week. A lot of appointments to cover, still going. Working a 8 bit version to use as a template and demo for b.i.t. Going pretty well. Having to do some off and on work.
				    I will update as I can this week and get some video (gifs) out of the version. Hope everyone is having a great spring.   <p>

				<br><br>
				04/16/24
				<p> Worked on B.i.T this week. Did some programming for collisions and movement. Ran into a bug so will have to research some more. Thinking the resolution may have an implication into the 
				    reasoning for the problem. Fist time using tile collision system and not too familiar with the concept as a whole. This week will stick with the programming portion and work on the animation
				   phase of the game. Alot of changes around the homefront. Will be working in and out of the office. Weather is being punctual at its usual time. Spurring up with storms. Will see how things 
				   get going. Hope everyone is doing well. Cheers.  <p>

				<br><br>
				04/09/24
				<p> Whew!, talk about being busy this month so far. Busy, Busy, Busy. For starters spring break hit. Alot of work on the house, alot of prepping for the summer.  As it may be, the game as you can
				    figure has been slowed again. Albeit not on pause, but has been in the mix of things. Also, I have been working on publishing a book having a template for game design journaling. This is a side
				    project that I wanted to push for some time. Not only to discover the process, but also work on a smaller project for interest in game development. Also, building some books on the subject matter
				    that will be a bit more in depth to game development. Following formats, illustration, build up of text, all meaningful aspects to get a bearing on the aspect of writing and publishing. As for 
				    building B.i.T, there is always something on the horizon to accomplish in short spirts. Happy to be on an upswing. Will be posting next week. Cheers and have fun!  <p>

				<br><br>
				03/20/24
				<p> I apologize for the lateness of this posting this week. Been really busy  with B.i.T...OH YEAH! Its been a colossal, huge improvement on getting things done. Now, of course, I will get a call for a 				    job or something with the family will pop off. Just the way it goes. Putting in some more transition pages ie. sprites. Still progressing on the backs. Going to be fun when everything is running and 				    the  game is in action. Hope all enjoy the incumbent mystery, suspense and relative gameplay. Hope everyone is doing there best. Almost the middle of the year. Another Quarter down. Take care, until 				    next time.    <p>

				<br><br>
				03/11/24
				<p> Back again with another awsome update! Working panels and made the lean-to for the caveman area. Going on strong. Will be pulling different angles here in teh later part of the week. Going
				    to look into two effects. One is the transition effect when the time warp pops off, the other will be a weather effect depending on the days. Both should come out pretty well I am thinking
				    going to post some images here on friday is the plan.  Will see what transpires. Ecstatic to be on a roll again. Still pushing for a demo here soon. Nothing pivitol at the moment. But, 
				    progression none the least. Hope all is new this week for everyone. Getting close to spring break. Will ahve down time then. Not much I will be doing, but maybe some jam time for the game.
				    As always, keep things going, have a blessed day! Cheers! <p>

				<br><br>
				03/04/24
				<p> Good Day to everyone. I am ecstatic with work on B.i.T. more backgrounds updated. Getting work down now. Enjoying my time on the project as always. Getting all the backgrounds done up for each
				    time zone is going well. Will be taking up alot of time on the game of course. No artist to work with me, LOL, just me. I enjoy it though. Fun to have the picture pour out to the pallet. Did a little 				    adjustment to the movement and still have to work on the animations of the characters. Bounced around a bit to get the backgrounds going as it is until I get the animations done for 10,000 B.C. man. 				    But in no rusht to perform the steps and not have a running game as it should be. I think that is the nice thing with being a solo dev, on one note its time you need to make a great game. On the 					    other wanting to have a finished product quickly with no errors or problems can be daunting. Mastering the tools for this job is going to be an ongoing practice. No defining key language to use
				    for the program. The family is doing well. Colds have deminished to a great point. Winter weather is the worst when it comes to kids and school. Well I ranted enough and hope everyones day is going
				    well also. Hard to believe the year is almost to June. Nice feeling, as also the kids will be out of school. Slow intake on B.i.T, but it will get there. Until next week!<p>
				<br><br>
				02/28/2024
				<p>GOOD MORNING everyone! Nice to be feeling much better then the pre-cold session. Not the greatest days this last month. So very thankful that things have passed and getting back to the regular
				   me of feeling better. Made some progress in B.i.T with the church scene inside. I nkow being down with a cold should inspire some mood to aggresively persue programming; but in the same rest was 					   beneficial to getting better. Working steadfast into more content. Still working to spur a demo, still doing animations, still progressing on the internet to get some feedback. Still working towards
				   building the content up. I have some work to do on the homestead, may take up some of my days here in the next month. I'll keep everyone posted as usual. Thanks for hanging in there with me in the 
				   days coming. Excited to be back in the seat. God bless everyone and hope your New Year is going as well as hoped. Cheers!<p>
				<br><br>
				02/20/24
				<p>Rebounding pretty well here last couple of days. been working on the chapel inside, smoke for the volcano, and some movement for the characters. All in all a good set of days. Feeling better
				  a few little quirks that pop up with the congestion. Seeing the doc friday to straighten out the hangups. But I feel more enthusiastic with some new modeling and programming. Hope everyone
				  is doing well and take care of yourselves. I hear there is alot of stuff floating around and its giving a lasting impression of woes. Hang in there if you are. Cheers.</p>
				<br><br>
				02/6/24
				<p>Well, I don't know if its the season, just my time for challenges, or just a long tenure to complete the work I am trying to accomplish here. I have been battling kidney stones, a cold, congestion, 				   now a blown eardrum, on the way to the other one having the same problem, several trips to teh emergency room for pain, dehydration, etc. Not sure what to do now other then wait this all out. I am 				   going to take some time to heal up. Not sure when I will continue  the game for the next month. But just have to take time for myself and figure ths all out. Thanks for stopping in and checking up.</p>
				<br><br>
				01/30/24
				<p>Hello everyone, back with another update. Worked some functionality into the game. Going to set up the basic layout and movement so to speak. Going to push for some readability through basic coding.
				    Also changing a bit of the storyline as well for some humor to the npc interactions. Hopefully it finds and picks peoples brains into a lighter mood. I'm feeling better, still battling some issues  				    over the term of my regiment. Keep pushing forward. Some side projects as well. Not to deep in though just some active learning and discovery. May start a broadcast of making the game. Picked the 				    brain a bit the other day on mnadelbrot inclusion with quantum computing as a linear product to produce an iterative value to increase the threshold of computing power. Maybe a step forward or 					    back in a build concept. </p>
				<br><br>
				01/23/24
				<p>My biggest apology to everyone for not being up to date with the current build. Alot of New Year health inpromptu's so far. Not been feeling the best in many ways. Had to take a step back and 
				   tend to the body. Years of pushing the extreme and finally have to succumb to life as a whole. Will be slowly adding new content and work forward. Taking back the time I need for some healthy 
				   living. Never think of the riggers on a daily just passing the time along with making the interest of each day successful. Hope everyone is doing well. Cheers.  </p>
				01/02/24
				<p> HAPPY NEW YEAR! To one and all! Hope the new year is bringing in what you want/deserve. On to the agenda. Hitting up the game today. Not sure what is going to happen, but I am going to work
				    on the next portion of game dev'n. Nice to be home and have the time to work without any thought interruptions. New year, new system of work. Side hustling is at a stop till paperwork follows 
				    through. Change of venue. Hope all is starting of well for ya. Enjoy the New Year, The New You. Cheers.   </p>
				<br><br>
				12/29/23
				<p>Sending out a new update, was going to wait till the end of the New Years and update back on schedule. Made it past the colds portion in the family. Easy when not inundated with coughing
				   and sneezing all the time in and around everyone. All in all, we swept accross the map in colds. Bronchitis has passed thankfully. Just a little touch of the allergies. Still processing 
				   some and a bit of each as it is. Will start working on B.i.T as the new year comes about. Hope everyone is doing well. Thanks for visiting and listening. Cheers. Happy New Year!   </p>

				<br><br>
				12/20/23
				<p>Well, you gotta love the winter months.  Lets start with the physical side of the tings. Woke to some severe pain two and half weeks ago. Felt like kidney
				   stone number three. Went to the ER and I not only have a kidney stone but, I also had a severe UTI. Ok goes hand in hand. Ok prepped for the greater problems
				   ahead. CLearing up the infection, passing the stone, good times as always. Day thwo, went on a trip around town with the wife. Had some strange feelings in the 
				   chest. Little flutters that were not going away. Couple of minutes, still happening. Hmmm better see the doc again and make sure prior work for the heart is all
				   golden. Yeah, no fear. All good. Excellent labs, except one minor lab with magnesium depletion. Good to ago! UNFORTUNATELY, there was a person, sitting down from
				   the clinical area I was utilizing, had bronchitis and was not cevering her face, not wearing a mask, being rather untactful with her cold symptoms and was moving
				   about while coughing frequently. SO Needless to say I have been recovering back to back with said symptoms since. Not too bad today, but, recovering. So said off time
				   has been sufficated with healing and not only myslef, but the entire household has been dealing with the flu. (Crossd fingers) not going that route so far. Lots of 
				   sanitizer. Lots of sleep. Wanted to get this out to let everyone know I hadn't stopped. Hadn't forgot. And said jobs have been in slow mode. Not pleased with myself
				   but healing and sleep are number one in my time right now. Will creep up on some more things. The T-shirt thing will have to wait. Still working on this stone. May be a bit
				   to get by with. AS alway, I hope everyone is doing well. I hope and pray your holidays are with great success. Enjoy your time. Take care of yourself. Enjoy any breaks.
					Cheers.  </p>
				<br><br>
				12/3/23
				<p>Hope everyone had a great thanksgiving; worked a bit this holiday and took some time with family. I worked the panel for a different time zone and corrected some
				   animation parts to the neanderthal. May seem like a litte bit and pieces, yet in the same put in alot of hours to the new job. Started up again since my hours are
				   non-existant. Not sure what is happening with the second job as the corrospondence has left me a bit in the unclear zone. Have to follow up here. Took some time 
				   today to scope out more plans for B.i.T and press forward on the project. On a side not a trip to the hospital last night didn't feel to much in the positive mood
				   to work on anything. BUt, what can you do. Still recouping but wanted to get a message out and keep everyone up to date. Prepping for christmas. Thanks for tuning in.
				   Cheers.  </p>
				<br><br>
				11/19/23
				<p>Changed my goal amount on gofundme since working on the side has started. Figured it will be a long haul in completing the project of now. Will work intermittently as 
				   time permits. Since its a retail job the season is upon us. So I will be in the thrall of work until next year.The project will stall from here on 
				   out until I get back to normal hours and such. Hope everyone is a having a great holiday season. </p>
				<br><br>
				11/13/2023
				<p>Not alot done this week as the job training kicked in. Also I have another opportunity abound this week. So as it will go B.i.T will be on the slow track
				   until I break even in time and start treading where game meets progress. Still working on the animations, might sling into another room for a time zone.
				   All depends on the scedule that pops here in the future. All in all its a likly vert to find the scheduling I need. Also looking for a side hustle that 
				   is not too heavy in the time needs arena. Will see what happens. Like to buy a shirt, well, that is coming also. Have to put my creative cap on for this
				   but seems to be a lucrative aspiration also. Have a safe and productive week. Cheers.</p>
				<br><br>
				11/7/2023
				<p> A day late posting, my apologies to everyone. Its been a busy start of the week. New job and preperations. Started to append animations for the neanderthal, adjusting and trimming actions
				    a bit of progression towards fluid movement. On the other hand using basic tools seems to help with the process. I hope to finish out this week on the neanderthal and progress to the next
				    character in the same process. Not sure the pick yet. Hope everyones week started off well. I'll keep pressing! Cheers</p>
 
				<br><br>
				10/30/2023
				<p>Okay, well its been going slow right now. Unfortunate that I only have a few images to show as I am working with the animation of characters,
				    I will admit I am low skilled in animation of this level. With that being said, I am working diligently on many levels to bring quality
				    animation to the characters. Plenty of time to do this. I am not rushing it. I believe a great product to the society is paramount in going 
				    forward even though its a slow, slow pace. Being a one man studio feels great. In the same, it goes tough. The job search has ended. 
				    I will be in processing here this week, soooo...as it will be on the off time to work on B.i.T; unless????? Monitization changes abruptly 
				    and I have a regular monthly income to supplment the process. Be patient, be kind. Check back regularly. appreciate you for coming by. Cheers.</p>
				<br><br>
				10/23/2023
				<p>Well, we start the new week early this morning stepping ahead with more work. Did some panels this weekend, and started to get the characters movement in order. I will work some more timeline panels as I go
				Animation work looms in the future as I write. Planning to get a PR package out with NPC's, a little brief interaction, and at least a view point of characters in the mix here hopefully by the end of the year. 
				On a side note, this is the pre-production phase of the process. 
				I will tweak and work graphics as I go along to make it more appealing and play worthy. So don't be disheartened at the basic flow of graphics at this point. Much to do in the future.
				I will continue to work adamantly on B.i.T. "Time is the passion of sought rewards." Not sure who said sucha  phrase, but it keys well with working this project. On that note, in a previous blogg entry 
				on the home page I noted a job offer looms in the future. I will be interviewed this Friday for a part time position and continue the same speed working on B.i.T. without hinderance. As always schedules often conflict
				, but I will keep everyone updated. That is why support is greatly needed to gain provincial headway into B.i.T, through amazing people like you,  helping with revenue. All donations are greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great week!</p>

				<br><br>
				10/15/2023
				<p>Updating early to start the week. As of right now I shut down kickstarter after finding out that pledges cost you regardless if the money
				is delivered. That is a huge budget concern since, well the funders are you. And if it is pulled and I am left holding the bag, it will get
				slim on going ahaed with working on the game. With that being said, a job offer may be in the not so far distance. I was hoping to dedicate
				my time to the game and nothing more. Althought the government looks to be doing not so well, the loom of shutdown could prove to be a large
				problem in the long run. Trivial as life is, I have to persue the doubt and plan. Still pressing forward with B.i.T. And with your help 
				this will be a great transition from dependecy outside the office. Hope everyone is doing well.</p>

				<br><br>
				10/9/2023
				<p>Started a indiegogo page but reviews show they have some non-reputable connections and failure to pay the individual. Also started a kickstarter page. 
				Red tape is a common theme and looks as though it only will last 60 days. Not alot you can do in a short time. Once red tape is cleared (cross fingers) 
				starting up soon. Filled out go fund me page. Great success, as usual, working towards a finale of a game I had working on for years. Please support if 
				feel you should. Thanks Busy, Busy, Busy.</p>
 
				<br><br>
				10/6/2023
				<p>Been a minute since the last blogg note. But I have been heavily at work with B.i.T. Alot of new designs and tooling around with ideas as of late. 
				Liking the motivation lately. Clips are below to enjoy and see my progress. Please stop by on occasion to see updates. Would really appreciate it.</p>

				<br><br>
				9/26/2023
				<p>Well the family is sick . I am hanging in there pretty well considering. Had a touch of it for a day. Not much else going on taking care of everyone while I am going through the phases. 
				Wife is really sick though. She is in a rough spot. Taking care of her and hopeffully get back to nominal stage before work becomes hectic. On a side note did some programming for Lazy Vault. 
				Not what I intended for the actions of each monster but its in the process. Not much else going on. Starfield is taking up most of the time these days. Having to get house chores done. 
				Hope everyone is getting ready for Halloween and Turkey day. Yatta, Yatta, Yata, all is not bad. Cheers.</p>





				<br><br>
				9/17/2023
				<p>Busy this last week, appointments, the job and kids.....kids what can you do. After a bit of running around all day and night I sit and log some hours on starfield. Long night
				night of playing. Can't...seem...to....recover..LOL. Far beyond from being motivated to do any kind of work or glamourous meaningful work habits. Need to get in gear as the 
				school year will be coming to a close in the distant future. Cooler days mean more shop time also. Gotta get all this stuff organized and cleaned up.
				<br>
				On that note I will close for now. Hope everyone is doing well and preping for the holidays. Cheers.</p>

					

				<br><br>
				9/11/23
				<p>Busy week this last week and the week coming up. Been a few days and can't believe how time has passed. Appointments, side hustle for some cash, and leaning out
				the finances. Big time backstuff for the betterment of home life. 9/11. Remember the day as yesterday. Not much to say about what transpired. Happy I served my country 
				and hope the big wigs come down off their horse to understand the losses we endured throughout enduring freedom, and many missions after each one. Sad we have to live in
				a society that has very little culture, pride, and morale implications. Life was good without affronted positions and indifference was a measure of honesty.  Much more I could remark
				but it is what it is. Won't change anytime soon until America sees the ugly truth of its ways. Sadly it may be at the behest of dictators.
				<br>
				On another note the website sits for a bit and I recoup from some side money. Of course, as a space junky, Starfield was released, and has taken up some off time in the present tense of 
				down time. GREAT GAME, just wish it wasn't so hardware intensive. Again, it is what it is. Will be doubling down on play time while appointments riddle the schedule the following days.
				Will play in between and such. Will get back to the programming monster her in a few. Finally have the kids back to school. Peace to everyone and cheers.</p>

 
				 	
				<br><br>
				9/5/23
				<p>Updated the home buttons on the site for navigation. Looking at CSS stuff for the future with some effects and thinking of a way to go
				about doing it. Waiting for starfield to launch here at 8 pm. Gonna test the waves and see the moniker 
				planets and scenarios perported. </p>

				<br><br>
				9/4/23
				<p>Not much on the ToDo list this day. went to get groceries, pretty much cleaning. Tomorrow is anther cleaning day. The chitlens are going to 
				school after the Labor Day weekend. Done some renevating on the sie. Setting up the pages. Had a good time building the icons
				for the buttons. Will do some after effects on the buttons to show selection. For now its doable. Spinning up on the games here. Will see what happens.</p>
				
	
				 <br><br>
				9/3/23
				<p>Interesting, I watched a backcast on Microsoft xBox and its uprising to control the gaming market through bullying the game industry
				pushing out Sony. This will be one to watch and evolve into a riger against the player (customer) in my opinion. </p>
	
				<br><br>
				9/2/2023
				
				<p>I have been working on a vault style game with FPS shooting viewpoint. While the game is promising there is challenges using 
				GameMaker Studio. Will be working on the website off and on so more to come along with navigation, extra pages, and links.</p>	
				<br><br>
